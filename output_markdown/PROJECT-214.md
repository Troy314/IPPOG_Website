## Abstract
ScienzaPerTutti is the INFN official website for communication and dissemination, born in 2002 with the aim of raising (or increase) interest and curiosity in people towards scientific topics, focusing on physics and INFN-related research topics. The project evolved, expanding its “offer” and involving schools and the public.
